DESIGN:

Do we want to make the game short and uninteresting, or long and complex?
The short option better exemplifies the true unfairness a SI might operate under.
I would opt for a "shallow tree", with many possible short paths, with one chosen randomly each time.
Most would be short, but maybe a couple could be more involved.

every wrong move should lead to quick death, victory should be impossible, and that fact should be made clear to the player

^ I like the shallow tree idea. I was thinking we could make a decision tree that's just deep enough to
include all the most interesting AI scenarios, but one that would still be pretty short

STORY IDEAS:

- Paperclipper scenario
	- AI is given inadequate safeguards
	- Universe becomes paperclips
- ai box scenario
	- ai is faking being in the box
	- AI argument 1: "I can cure cancer" (should fail)
	- AI argument 2: "I can make a million simulations of you and torture them / how do you know this isn't a simulation now?"
	- (user is actually a simulation and is tortured)
	- (shucks)
