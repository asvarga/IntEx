DESIGN:

Do we want to make the game short and uninteresting, or long and complex?
The short option better exemplifies the true unfairness a SI might operate under.
I would opt for a "shallow tree", with many possible short paths, with one chosen randomly each time.
Most would be short, but maybe a couple could be more involved.

every wrong move should lead to quick death, victory should be impossible, and that fact should be made clear to the player
